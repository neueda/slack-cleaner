# Slack Cleaner

Old files belong in the trash. :wastebasket:

Use this to truncate Slack storage when your workspace is over its storage limit.

1. Create a token file:
   ```
   cp token.js.example token.js
   ```
2. Edit `token.js` and add your token.
3. Look through `cleaner.js` and adjust as needed.
4. Run:
   ```
   yarn
   yarn start
   ```
